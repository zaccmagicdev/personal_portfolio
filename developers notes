6/11/25:
- formatted some wording    
- looking into responsiveness
- adding a gravity deature?
- adding a feature where it's easy to add a project card with a token perhaps


6/13/25:
- adding some pixelated icons and what not


6/16/25:
- get my own images (zach) in the slideshow and make that UI look more like the rest of the site
- look into how to make this responsive


IT WOULD BE REALLY COOL IF I COULD RELEASE THIS ON ONE OF MY DAYS OFF

6/24/25:
- learned that !important css tag works as an override
-what I'm going to have to do is go through all the elements in the slides to see what's not making things shrink past ~870px
